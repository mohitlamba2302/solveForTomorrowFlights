python flask API is made-

it scrapes two websites, [easemytrip.com, ixigo.com]

uses selenium web driver and beautiful soup,

fetches all flight details from one airport in the list to other,

the list of airports can be extended,

data fetched has the following attributes = {
	"website",
	"airline_name",
	"plane_number":,
	"date": ,
	"departure_airport":,
	"departure_time":,
	"arrival_airport":,
	"arrival_time":,
	"flight_duration":,
	"stops":,
	"original_price":,
	"reduced_price":,
	"offers":
} 

the flight details are looped through the airport list, for a particular date, and data from generated URS is fetched dynamically, 

That data is sent to a node.js server which populates the database with that data.

it is a batch process where database is updated after all flight details for flights from port(A)->port(B) where A,B belongs to the list, is scraped.

This process runs every 15 minutes, so that entire database is updated with new flight prices after every 15 mins.
